<p>To ask who or what I am almost seems like an unnecessary question on my part by this point. You’re already aware that I’m an author and philosopher. But instead of writing “About Jack Abaza,” I thought it seemed more intuitive to ask the question anyway, since there is a deeper sense of individuality than merely stating what I generally do, i.e., writing, philosophizing, etc.</p>
<p>Answering who or what I am, then, will require a brief detour down memory lane. It seems almost as if it were yesterday that I was in Seneca College, studying for my Law Clerk diploma, with the hopes of transferring over to York University. From there, I’d be able to study Law and Society and enrol in Osgoode Hall, becoming a lawyer after several years. This was twenty years ago.</p>
<p>Eventually, I was on track to realizing that goal, to become a lawyer; I got into university, but I wasn’t enrolled in Law and Society immediately. I remember the registration office sending me a letter that I may only choose a program after one semester—that was my “penance” for mediocre grades in college.
<p>So, one afternoon during my semester of penance, I joined a colleague during break, and I wondered how he managed to out-debate our outspoken professor, who carried massive authority behind his words. The answer? He didn’t quite say. But he said he was sick of his philosophy major, sick of the lack of job opportunities for philosophy graduates, and wanted to switch to marketing instead. He was warning me not to take philosophy, and while he may have persuaded our professor to admit he was wrong (something that seemed impossible then), his complaints about philosophy aroused my interest.</p>
<p>Weeks or months later, I remember browsing the net to see which majors performed best on LSAT, and can you guess those who consistently had top scores, from writing to reasoning? Philosophy majors. Music, physics, English literature, and mathematics majors scored high, but they weren’t well-rounded, having strengths here and there and dropping when evaluated in different respects. Philosophy was consistently at the top, whereas—if memory serves—Law and Society was somewhat good, but not outstanding. So, based on that one engagement, along with that conversation, the scales of my opinion tipped in favour of a philosophy major, and I made the switch.</p>
<p>Initially, I struggled to adjust to philosophy, as my writing wasn’t great. But I had to swim or drown, and the only way to stay afloat in philosophy is to immerse yourself into it—if you’re not obsessed with it, giving up your social life, exercise, sleep, hobbies, etc., then you’re not going to do that well. (That’s for beginners—philosophy gets much easier after.) I, then, went from a bad student to a straight-A student within a year and ended up forgetting about wanting to become a lawyer.</p>
<p>The immersion I had in philosophy was so extreme that the sort of problems that someone wouldn’t think twice about, or would struggle to remember, were giving me insomnia. Can you be sure you possess knowledge? Are you sure your experiences aren’t hallucinated or dreamt? How do you know you’re awake and in contact with reality? How do you know you exist? What’s it all about? And, in the far corners of philosophical discussions, I kept hearing echoes of a legendary problem that so-called “problem-solvers” gave up on solving.</p>
<p>Like an awful rendition of J.K. Rowling’s Voldemort, philosophers dare not speak that problem’s name. What is it? It’s been around for as long as we could conceive of ourselves as living and thinking things. Yet no one in philosophy dares speak it casually, as if it were the Second Temple Period when Judaic priests only spoke of YHWH’s name once a year in the holiest of religious places. What is the meaning of life? No one had solved it, yet it had been around in one form or another since the time Confucius and his disciples “philosophized” about how we should live. So, what have philosophers done about it in 2,500 years? Essentially, nothing. Now, the so-called profession of solving problems turned intellectual cowardice into a “discipline,” chiding anyone who dare attempts to find logical solutions to puzzles that are believed too “holy” to be solved.</p>
<p>Sickened by the corruption, and after having graduated, I disassociated from my peers. The rancid smell of intellectual cowardice was too unbearable. I, thus, resolved to solving that problem day and night, day and night, year after year, until my heart was ready to give out on me. Still, I had a point to prove. I carried a grudge: that problem is mine. I’m going to solve it no matter what.</p>
<p>They say that the meaning of life is a matter of perspective, subjective; if not those, it’s something up to someone’s religion’s god or something. Never in all these years had someone bothered to actually learn what the question means, by defining it. Top philosophers, as I’ve come to learn, kept making the sorts of mistakes that they warned students against, so that they write true premises, make a logically valid argumentative structure, and the conclusion must follow from these premises, making the argument sound (as in deductive and true). And what have philosophers done with the meaning of life? The opposite.</p>
<p>Hundreds of academic articles and books are published on this subject, yet the likes of a former Aristotelian Society president or another famous name, could not get a grip on nuance. They assumed that words ‘life’ and ‘meaning’ are static; that their grammatical plurality or singularity is irrelevant; they just jumped in to answer that question, baiting-and-switching one word’s meaning for the next. And to think that these are the same individuals who would say that the meaning of life can’t be solved, or if it can be solved, their god holds its answer, is hypocrisy—it's the very sort of hypocrisy that philosophy professes to scrutinize; but who is keeping philosophers in check?</p>
<p>Returning to who or what I am, this is my villain origin story. I’m the philosopher that other philosophers dread to debate. Because when we have a conversation about difficult questions, I always ask them, “What do you mean by that word?” Philosophers, since Thales of Miletus came back from Egypt 2,600 years ago, had been greatly misguided about how interconnected thought and reasoning are with language. To be an excellent philosopher isn’t the chauvinism of making the weaker argument the stronger one, but to understand how precisely our words move mountains. They made me. I didn’t do anything, really. They made me. And, now, I made it my life’s goal to question all questions philosophers fear to ask. No assumption, not even the one that we supposedly exist, is safe from analytic scrutiny. If we don’t exist, so be it; if morality is just a superstition, so be it; if the truth is but a word embedded in an assumed convention, rather than one that can be demonstrated, so be it. They made philosophy, defined its practice, and I’m just following that practice all the way through. It's as the old adage says, "Be careful what you wish for." Maybe philosophy was merely a stage play, not intending to really question the most prized illusions, but, then, they should've been clearer on that before I got started.</p>
