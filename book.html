    <p>[The last philosophical investigation of the inquiry; it’s intended to bring a finality to the grand, perennial question: What is the meaning of life?

Over the course of many centuries, this question persisted in various forms. But never have philosophers sought to frame the question properly. Rather than brazenly rushing its answer, not a single intellectual—since the day Confucius’ disciplines picked up reed pens and wrote the analects—thought to ask, “What does ‘What is the meaning of life?’ mean?”

It sounds like a stupid suggestion, but omissions done from the arrogance of intellectual pride cascade into monolithic errors, misleading generations because a man couldn’t think so start from the basics, the very sort of elementary work these very same philosophers constantly demand of their students.

Thus, this book leads the way to an incredible insight that had never been seen before in philosophy and marks one of the few events in the discipline’s history that a magnificent problem, such as the meaning of life is, had been put to rest.

Don’t you want to know the secret that no one believed was possible to uncover?
